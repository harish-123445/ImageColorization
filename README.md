# Image Colorization App

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that allows users to upload black-and-white (grayscale) images and receive **colorized images** generated by a deep learning model.

The backend uses **PyTorch** with a custom-trained model (based on FastAI and image colorization techniques) to process and colorize the uploaded images. The frontend is built using **HTML, CSS** for a simple, interactive user interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Upload a grayscale image via the web interface.
* Backend model automatically colorizes the image.
* Real-time preview of the uploaded and processed results.
* Supports most common image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### **Frontend**

* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
  
### **Backend**

* Python 3
* Flask (Web Framework)
* PyTorch (Deep Learning)
* FastAI (High-level training utilities)
* NumPy, Pillow, Matplotlib, Scikit-Image

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harish-123445/ImageColorization.git
cd ImageColorization
```

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment & install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Flask application

```bash
python app.py
```

### 4️⃣ Open the app in your browser

```

## 🖼 How It Works

1. User uploads a grayscale image.
2. Flask saves the uploaded image to `uploads/`.
3. Backend model processes the image using **PyTorch & FastAI**.
4. Colorized image is saved in `results/` and displayed on the frontend.

## 📦 Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` with:

```
flask
torch
torchvision
fastai
numpy
pillow
scikit-image
matplotlib
tqdm
```
